# Causal Inference
I decided to develop a series of tutorials on causal inference methods for observational studies after receiving reviewer feedback asking to address endogeneity issues in some of my submitted manuscripts. While working on those revisions, I thought to create a workshop focused on methods designed to tackle challenges in observational data analysis. These are some of the topics I plan to cover. Each topic presents a method(s) to tackle specific inference problems inherent to observational data, where treatment assignment is not randomized and confounding is a major concern. Moving forward, I aim to expand this effort by creating YouTube videos and blog posts.
